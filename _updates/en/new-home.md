After 2 months, I am back on my website with some exciting news! 

I didn't have much time to update this website but I am now back and ready to roll out more updates.

# Training

So far this year we have had 3 training cycles completed. Each training cycle consist of 3 weeks. 

> #### - Week #1
> The first week of the cycle is the easiest. On that week we will have trainings that are shorter but that still require concentration to execute perfectly. On the first week we go through a new training program and that requires a good amount of concentration to execute perfectly since we will be doing that same program for the 3 week cycle. 
> #### - Week #2
> The second week of the cycle is usually the one where you feel in shape. On that week you start to get challenged a bit more in the weight room and in sprint training. We will have trainings that last close to 2h in the weight room, 3 times a week. On top of training in the gym we will also have ice sessions and cycling.
> #### - Week #3
> The third week of the cycle is the hardest. You are tired from the previous 2 weeks of training and the training volume is much higher. We usually have more sets to do in the weight room, more skating and more cycling. The encouraging thing about the third week is that once it's done we have a resting week! 

The second training cycle was a struggle for me because of a back injury that kept coming back. Thankfully this is now fixed and I am feeling healthy and strong. 


### Sprint Training

One of my favorite day of training in the week is the Sprint training outside.

# Moving! 

On the 1st of July my girlfriend and I moved into a bigger apartment closer to the Centre de Glaces Intant Assurances. We are just starting to enjoy it and getting settled in! 

I had been staying in the same apartment complex for almost 8 years... That's more than a third of my life and 2 Olympic cycles!! 

On the 2nd of July we also celebrated 5 years of love with a little diner accompanied by our cat Kiri.

# Incoming Sponsor!

One of my many goals for the 2022-2023 season was to find at least one sponsor to put on my Speed Skating Canada apparel. 

Mission Accomplished. 

With the help of my dad I managed to find a sponsor that hits close to home. This upcoming sponsor is closely related to SPEED Skating by it's name. Can you guess who it is? 

I will reveal it in another update where I will announce my new sponsor for the 2022-2023 season. In the meantime you can leave a comment on this post to guess who it could be.
