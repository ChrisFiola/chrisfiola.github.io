#### You will find here the filming process for the short film currently in the making.

## Quiet on the set!

I have been filming for almost a month now with my friend and speed skater Antoine GÃ©linas-Beaulieu. The goal of this short is to have a video that represents me and that we can use for a big filming contest.  

This will allow me to publish the short on youtube and also to put on the homepage of this website. That will make the homepage more interesting!  

The filming process will end no later than July 1st since this is this will be the last day to submit our short for the contest.

## What will it look like?

The goal is to really have a connection between skating, film making and all the different aspects of life.  

There will be fishing, inline in the street, inline in the "forest", inline in the skate park and some drone shots to capture it all.  

We will also have a Youtube style part where I will explain the different tools and equipment that I use to perform in skating.
