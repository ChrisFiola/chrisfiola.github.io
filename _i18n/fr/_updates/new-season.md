# Welcome Back!

Coming off a strong end of the season in 2021-2022, I couldn't wait to go back to training and push myself again. Last season was very odd and I had to overcome a lot of obstacles on the way to my personal bests in March 2022.  

#### First in the 500m

#### Second in the 1000m

I ended the year with a series of amazing race which allowed me to take the first spot in the canadian ranking for the 500m and the second spot in the 1000m. This was a big a relief for me as I struggled all season.

# What's for summer?

This summer I will keep doing what I was doing last year: 3 weight training session a week with bike and sprints on the side.

#### Stay Healthy, Focused and Smart
We got off to a slow start last season due to the lack of racing during the pandemic. The training was good and if we keep the same recipe we should have great results.

If you want to follow along in real time all my training is logged on my [**strava page**](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1186944). Even the walks in the park with my cat! *(yes that's a thing)*

An olympic cycle is 4 years and if I want to reach 2026 I have to make smart decisions and take care of my body. This will be the goal for this summer and for the whole season as well. I have a tendency to do too much by impulse... this will definitely be a challenge for me! :)

## When is the first race?

Racing does not begin officially until fall but we will have time trials here and there throughout the summer to get us ready before fall.  

Stay tuned to my [homepage](https://chrisfiola.github.io/home) for all the updates on the next events to come. You will find the next 3 upcoming events in that section.
